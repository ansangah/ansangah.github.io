Sang-A Ahn is a third-year undergraduate researcher in the Department of Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University. She is building a solid foundation in the mathematics and implementation of deep learning, with the goal of running large-scale experiments in GPU-accelerated environments. She currently belongs to the Medical AI & Computational Science Lab, where she is gaining hands-on research experience.

She has completed advanced machine learning courses grounded in linear algebra, probability, and optimization, and she maintains a Hugo-based technical blog to document research notes, project retrospectives, and paper reviewsâ€”strengthening her ability to communicate findings.

Having just taken her first steps into the broad field of deep learning, she is actively exploring career paths that allow her to engage with diverse AI technologies and applications rather than limiting herself to a single niche.

Looking ahead, she aims to experience a wide spectrum of AI domainsâ€”including multimodal models, prompt engineering, and high-performance computingâ€”to identify her core strengths. She places high value on research that extracts meaningful insights from data and on applying those insights to real-world services and collaborative settings.

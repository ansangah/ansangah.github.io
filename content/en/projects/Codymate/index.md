This is the frontend project of CodyMate.

CodyMate is a personalized outfit coordination application that turns your wardrobe digital.
By simply taking a photo, clothes are added to your in-app closet and can be matched based on **weather, mood, and location**.
The app features a **community space** for sharing styles, **AI-based outfit recommendations**, and a **body shape adjustment system** that helps visualize how clothes fit different body types.
Designed to enhance daily fashion decisions through intelligent and context-aware coordination.

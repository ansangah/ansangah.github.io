The app features a <strong>community</strong> space for sharing styles, <strong>AI-based outfit recommendations</strong>, and a <strong>body shape adjustment system</strong> that helps visualize how clothes fit different body types.
Designed to enhance daily fashion decisions through intelligent and context-aware coordination.
